	This was my first time to start to make a website from a scratch, and it was not easy for me to complete tasks that were given to me.
	First, it required me to create input elements that check if a user’s input was valid or invalid. Since I am not good at regular
expression, I looked a note of ULI101 which I was taking last semester because I remembered the ULI professor who taught me last semester
mentioned how to check postal code using regular expression. So I saw the lecture note and used it for this assignment. 
	Second, I used node to find bugs and also I checked if my webpage worked properly by clicking buttons, scrolling down a page and type
something in forms. The latter one was good to see visible errors. For example, even if npm does not find any errors, when a user clicked
option bar, the lists show up awkward direction. So there is something by only checking the website through your eyes. On the other hand, npm
showed me programming errors. For example, it told me that a name of font-family was encapsulated by “”, instead of ‘’ and told me which
line it caused. In this case, even though I used double quotations, css still worked but as a developer, we should not leave any errors. So
this is a good method to find errors.
	Third, I saw many website to come up with idea of design for my website and some of websites were not easy to see. For example, some
websites had social media links with just a name of it. Instead, using icon and the name of social media is way easier to see and makes people
more want to go to check their social media. If a webpage has “instagram” or the icon of Instagram as a link, I would want to click the icon.
Since it is not hard to change, I would tell them that icon makes visitors more interested than word from the user and developer’s perspective.
